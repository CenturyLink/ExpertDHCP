**ExpertDHCP Web UI Installation and Configuration**
-

The ExpertDHCP Web UI can be deployed in different ways. In cases where 
resources are limited, all three components, including the the Kea DHCP server,
the ExpertDHCP REST Service and the ExpertDHCP Web UI can be installed on the
same host.

In other cases, where multiple Kea DHCP servers are being controlled or where 
redundancy is needed, the ExpertDHCP Web UI can be deployed on separate physical
or virtual machines in a redundant fashion using a load balancing program such
as **KeepAlived**.
